  <h2 class='c006'>Functions of the Patent and Trademark Office</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is an agency of the U.S.
Department of Commerce. The role of the Patent and Trademark
Office is to grant patents for the protection of inventions and to register
trademarks. It serves the interest of inventors and businesses with
respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications.
It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the
Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in
matters involving “intellectual property” such as patents, trademarks
and semiconductor mask works. Through the preservation, classification,
and dissemination of patent information, the Office aids and
encourages innovation and the scientific and technical advancement
of the nation.</p>

<p class='c004'>In discharging its patent related duties, the Patent and Trademark
Office examines applications and grants patents on inventions when
applicants are entitled to them; it publishes and disseminates patent
information, records assignments of patents, maintains search files of
U.S. and foreign patents, and maintains a search room for public use
in examining issued patents and records. It supplies copies of patents
and official records to the public. Similar functions are performed
relating to trademarks.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Purpose of this Booklet</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The purpose of this booklet is to give users some general information
about patents and the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office.
It attempts to answer many of the questions commonly asked of the
Patent and Trademark Office but is not intended to be a comprehensive
textbook on patent law or a guide for the patent attorney. It is
hoped that this information will be useful to inventors and prospective
applicants for patents, to students, and to others who may be
interested in patents by giving them a brief general introduction to
the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>Additional information may be obtained from the publications listed
under the sections “Publications of the Patent and Trademark Office”
and “General information and correspondence.” Also, information is
available on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Web site at:
<i>http://www.uspto.gov</i>. The Patent and Trademark Office does not
publish any textbooks on patent law, but a number of such works for
the specialist and for the general reader have been published by
private concerns.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>What Is a Patent?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A patent for an invention is a grant of a property right by the
Government to the inventor (or his or her heirs or assigns), acting
through the Patent and Trademark Office. The term of the patent shall
be 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was
filed in the United States or, if the application contains a specific reference
to an earlier filed application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c),
from the date the earliest such application was filed, subject to the
payment of maintenance fees. The right conferred by the patent grant
extends only throughout the United States and its territories and
possessions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the
statute and of the grant itself, “the right to exclude others from making,
using, offering for sale, or selling” the invention in the United
States or “importing” the invention into the United States. What is
granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but
the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling
or importing the invention. Most of the statements in the preceding
paragraphs will be explained in greater detail in later sections.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some persons occasionally confuse patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
Although there may be some resemblance in the rights of
these three kinds of intellectual property, they are different and serve
different purposes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Copyrights</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A copyright protects the writings of an author against copying. Literary,
dramatic, musical and artistic works are included within the protection
of the copyright law, which in some instances also confers performing
and recording rights. The copyright protects the form of
expression rather than to the subject matter of the writing. A description
of a machine could be copyrighted as a writing, but this would
only prevent others from copying the description; it would not prevent
others from writing a description of their own or from making and
using the machine. Copyrights are registered in the Copyright Office in
the Library of Congress. Information concerning copyrights may be
obtained from the Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C. 20559. (Telephone 202–707–3000)</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Trademarks/Servicemarks</h3>

<p class='c011'>A trademark or servicemark relates to any word, name, symbol or
device which is used in trade with goods or services to indicate the
source or origin of the goods or services and to distinguish them from
the goods or services of others. Trademark rights may be used to prevent
others from using a confusingly similar mark but not to prevent
others from making the same goods or from selling them under a non-confusing
mark. Similar rights may be acquired in marks used in the
sale or advertising of services (service marks). Trademarks and service
marks which are used in interstate or foreign commerce may be
registered in the Patent and Trademark Office. The procedure relating
to the registration of trademarks and some general information concerning
trademarks is given in a separate pamphlet entitled “Basic
Facts About Trademarks.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Patent Laws</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Constitution of the United States gives Congress the power to
enact laws relating to patents, in Article I, section 8, which reads
“Congress shall have power&nbsp;... to promote the progress of science
and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors
the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” Under
this power Congress has from time to time enacted various laws relating
to patents. The first patent law was enacted in 1790. The law now
in effect is a general revision which was enacted July 19, 1952, and
which came into effect January 1, 1953. It is codified in Title 35, United
States Code.</p>

<p class='c004'>The patent law specifies the subject matter for which a patent may be
obtained and the conditions for patentability. The law establishes the
Patent and Trademark Office to administer the law relating to the
granting of patents, and contains various other provisions relating to
patents.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>What Can Be Patented</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The patent law specifies the general field of subject matter that can be
patented and the conditions under which a patent may be obtained.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the language of the statute, any person who “invents or discovers
any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition
of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a
patent,” subject to the conditions and requirements of the law. The
word “process” is defined by law as a process, act or method, and primarily
includes industrial or technical processes. The term “machine”
used in the statute needs no explanation. The term “manufacture”
refers to articles which are made, and includes all manufactured articles.
The term “composition of matter” relates to chemical compositions
and may include mixtures of ingredients as well as new chemical
compounds. These classes of subject matter taken together
include practically everything which is made by man and the processes
for making the products.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 excludes the patenting of inventions
useful solely in the utilization of special nuclear material or atomic
energy for atomic weapons.</p>

<p class='c004'>The patent law specifies that the subject matter must be “useful.” The
term “useful” in this connection refers to the condition that the subject
matter has a useful purpose and also includes operativeness, that is, a
machine which will not operate to perform the intended purpose
would not be called useful, and therefore would not be granted a
patent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Interpretations of the statute by the courts have defined the limits of
the field of subject matter which can be patented, thus it has been
held that the laws of nature, physical phenomena and abstract ideas
are not patentable subject matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>A patent cannot be obtained upon a mere idea or suggestion. The
patent is granted upon the new machine, manufacture, etc., as has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>been said, and not upon the idea or suggestion of the new machine. A
complete description of the actual machine or other subject matter for
which a patent is sought is required.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Novelty and Other Conditions for Obtaining a Patent</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In order for an invention to be patentable it must be new as defined in
the patent law, which provides that an invention cannot be patented if:</p>

<p class='c004'>“(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or
patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign
country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent,” or
“(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication
in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country
more than one year prior to the application for patent in the United
States&nbsp;...”</p>

<p class='c004'>If the invention has been described in a printed publication anywhere
in the world, or if it has been in public use or on sale in this country
before the date that the applicant made his/her invention, a patent
cannot be obtained. If the invention has been described in a printed
publication anywhere, or has been in public use or on sale in this
country more than one year before the date on which an application
for patent is filed in this country, a patent cannot be obtained. In this
connection it is immaterial when the invention was made, or whether
the printed publication or public use was by the inventor himself/herself
or by someone else. If the inventor describes the invention in a printed
publication or uses the invention publicly, or places it on sale, he/she
must apply for a patent before one year has gone by, otherwise any
right to a patent will be lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even if the subject matter sought to be patented is not exactly shown
by the prior art, and involves one or more differences over the most
nearly similar thing already known, a patent may still be refused if the
differences would be obvious. The subject matter sought to be patented
must be sufficiently different from what has been used or
described before that it may be said to be nonobvious to a person having
ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention. For
example, the substitution of one material for another, or changes in
size, are ordinarily not patentable.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The United States Patent and Trademark Office</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Congress established the United States Patent and Trademark Office to
issue patents on behalf of the Government. The Patent and Trademark
Office as a distinct bureau may be said to date from the year 1802
when a separate official in the Department of State who became
known as “Superintendent of Patents” was placed in charge of
patents. The revision of the patent laws enacted in 1836 reorganized
the Patent and Trademark Office and designated the official in charge
as Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. The Patent and
Trademark Office remained in the Department of State until 1849
when it was transferred to the Department of Interior. In 1925 it was
transferred to the Department of Commerce where it is today.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent and Trademark Office administers the patent laws as they
relate to the granting of patents for inventions, and performs other
duties relating to patents. It examines applications for patents to determine
if the applicants are entitled to patents under the law and grants
the patents when they are so entitled; it publishes issued patents and
various publications concerning patents, records assignments of
patents, maintains a search room for the use of the public to examine
issued patents and records, supplies copies of records and other
papers, and the like. Similar functions are performed with respect to
the registration of trademarks. The Patent and Trademark Office has
no jurisdiction over questions of infringement and the enforcement of
patents, nor over matters relating to the promotion or utilization of
patents or inventions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The head of the Office is the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and his staff includes the
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Deputy Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks, several assistant commissioners, and
other officials. As head of the Office, the Commissioner superintends
or performs all duties respecting the granting and issuing of patents
and the registration of trademarks; exercises general supervision over
the entire work of the Patent and Trademark Office; prescribes the
rules, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>conduct of proceedings in the Patent and Trademark Office, and for
recognition of attorneys and agents; decides various questions brought
before him by petition as prescribed by the rules; and performs other
duties necessary and required for the administration of the Patent and
Trademark Office.</p>

<p class='c004'>The work of examining applications for patents is divided among a
number of examining groups, each group having jurisdiction over certain
assigned fields of technology. Each group is headed by a group
director and staffed by examiners. The examiners review applications
for patents and determine whether patents can be granted. An appeal
can be taken to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences from
their decisions refusing to grant a patent, and a review by the
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may be had on other matters
by petition. The examiners also identify applications that claim the
same invention and initiate proceedings, known as interferences, to
determine who was the first inventor.</p>

<p class='c004'>In addition to the examining groups, other offices perform various services,
such as receiving and distributing mail, receiving new applications,
handling sales of printed copies of patents, making copies of
records, inspecting drawings, and recording assignments.</p>

<p class='c004'>At present, the Patent and Trademark Office has about 5,700 employees,
of whom about half are examiners and others with technical and
legal training. Patent applications are received at the rate of over
200,000 per year. The Patent and Trademark Office receives over five
million pieces of mail each year.</p>

intended for each subclass title; they serve as a guide to users of the
Manual of Classification to refer to the same subclass for patents on a
particular technology by eliminating, as much as possible, subjective
and varying interpretations of the meanings of subclass titles. The
“notes” illustrate the kinds of information that can be found in a subclass
and direct the searcher to other related subclasses which may

  <h2 class='c006'>General Information and Correspondence</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All business with the Patent and Trademark Office should be transacted
in writing and all correspondence relating to patent matters should be
addressed to “ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR PATENTS, WASHINGTON,
D.C. 20231.” Correspondents should be sure to include their full return
addresses, including zip codes. The principal location of the PTO is
Crystal Plaza 3, 2021 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia. The
personal presence of applicants at the PTO is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>Applicants and attorneys are required to conduct their business with
decorum and courtesy. Papers presented in violation of this requirement
will be returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Separate letters (but not necessarily in separate envelopes) should be
written for each distinct subject of inquiry, such as assignments, payments,
orders for printed copies of patents, orders for copies of
records, and requests for other services. None of these inquiries
should be included with letters responding to Office actions in applications.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a letter concerns a patent application, the correspondent must
include the application number, filing date, and Group Art Unit number.
When a letter concerns a patent, it must include the name of the
patentee, the title of the invention, the patent number, and the date of
issue.</p>

<p class='c004'>An order for a copy of an assignment must give the book and page, or
reel and frame of the record, as well as the name of the inventor; otherwise,
an additional charge is made for the time consumed in making
the search for the assignment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Applications for patents are not open to the public, and no information
concerning them is released except on written authority of the applicant,
his/her assignee, or his/her attorney, or when necessary to the
conduct of the business of the PTO. Patents and related records,
including records of any decisions, the records of assignments other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>than those relating to assignments of patent applications, books, and
other records and papers in the Office are open to the public. They
may be inspected in the Patent and Trademark Office Search Room or
copies may be ordered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Office cannot respond to inquiries concerning the novelty and
patentability of an invention in advance of the filing of an application;
give advice as to possible infringement of a patent; advise of the propriety
of filing an application; respond to inquiries as to whether, or to
whom, any alleged invention has been patented; act as an expounder
of the patent law or as counselor for individuals, except in deciding
questions arising before it in regularly filed cases. Information of a
general nature may be furnished either directly or by supplying or calling
attention to an appropriate publication.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Library, Search Room Services and Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Scientific and Technical Information Center of the Patent and
Trademark Office located at Crystal Plaza 3, 2C01, 2021 Jefferson Davis
Highway, Arlington, VA, has available for public use over 120,000 volumes
of scientific and technical books in various languages, about
90,000 bound volumes of periodicals devoted to science and technology,
the official journals of 77 foreign patent organizations, and over 40
million foreign patents on paper, microfilm, microfiche, and CD-ROM.
The Scientific and Technical Information Center is open to the public
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except federal holidays.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent Search Room located at Crystal Plaza 3, 1A01, 2021 Jefferson
Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, is provided where the public may search
and examine United States patents granted since 1790. Patents are
arranged according to the U.S. Patent Classification System of over 400
classes and over 136,000 subclasses. By searching in these classified
groupings of patents, it is possible to determine, before actually filing
an application, whether an invention has been anticipated by a United
States patent, and it is also possible to obtain the information contained
in patents relating to any field of endeavor. The Patent Search
Room contains a set of United States patents arranged in numerical
order and a complete set of the Official Gazette.</p>

<p class='c004'>A Files Information Room also is maintained where the public may
inspect the records and files of issued patents and other open records.
Applicants, their attorneys or agents, and the general public are not
entitled to use the records and files in the examiners’ rooms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent Search Room is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday except on Federal holidays.</p>

<p class='c004'>Since a patent is not always granted when an application is filed,
many inventors attempt to make their own search of the prior patents
and publications before applying for a patent. This may be done in the
Patent Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>libraries, located throughout the U.S., which have been designated as
Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries (PTDLs). An inventor may
make a preliminary search through the United States patents to discover
if the particular invention or one similar to it has been shown in the prior
patent. An inventor may also employ patent attorneys or agents to perform
the preliminary search. This search is not always as complete as
that made by the Patent and Trademark Office during the examination
of an application, but only serves, as its name indicates, a preliminary
purpose. For this reason, the Patent and Trademark Office examiner
may, and often does, reject claims in an application on the basis of
prior patents or publications not found in the preliminary search.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those who cannot come to the Patent Search Room may order from
the Patent and Trademark Office copies of lists of original patents or of
cross-referenced patents contained in the subclasses comprising the
field of search, or may inspect and obtain copies of the patents at a
Patent and Trademark Depository Library. The Patent and Trademark
Depository Libraries (PTDLs) receive current issues of U.S. Patents and
maintain collections of earlier issued patents and trademark information.
The scope of these collections varies from library to library, ranging
from patents of only recent years to all or most of the patents issued
since 1790.</p>

<p class='c004'>These patent collections are open to public use. Each of the PTDLs, in
addition, offers the publications of the U.S. Patent Classification System
(e.g., Manual of Classification, Index to the U.S. Patent Classification
System, Classification Definitions, etc.) and other patent documents
and forms, and provides technical staff assistance in their use to aid
the public in gaining effective access to information contained in
patents. The collections are organized in patent number sequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Available in all PTDLs is the Cassis CD-ROM system. With various files,
it permits the effective identification of appropriate classifications to
search, provides numbers of patents assigned to a classification to
facilitate finding the patents in a numerical file of patents, provides the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>current classification(s) of all patents, permits word searching on classification
titles, and on abstracts, and provides certain bibliographic
information on more recently issued patents.</p>

<p class='c004'>Facilities for making paper copies from microfilm, the paper bound
volumes or CD-ROM are generally provided for a fee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Due to variations in the scope of patent collections among the PTDLs
and in their hours of service to the public, anyone contemplating the
use of the patents at a particular library is advised to contact that
library, in advance, about its collection, services, and hours, so as to
avert possible inconvenience.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Attorneys and Agents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The preparation of an application for patent and the conducting of the
proceedings in the Patent and Trademark Office to obtain the patent is
an undertaking requiring the knowledge of patent law and rules and
Patent and Trademark Office practice and procedures, as well as
knowledge of the scientific or technical matters involved in the particular
invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inventors may prepare their own applications and file them in the
Patent and Trademark Office and conduct the proceedings themselves,
but unless they are familiar with these matters or study them in
detail, they may get into considerable difficulty. While a patent may be
obtained in many cases by persons not skilled in this work, there
would be no assurance that the patent obtained would adequately
protect the particular invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Most inventors employ the services of registered patent attorneys or
patent agents. The law gives the Patent and Trademark Office the
power to make rules and regulations governing conduct and the
recognition of patent attorneys and agents to practice before the
Patent and Trademark Office. Persons who are not recognized by the
Patent and Trademark Office for this practice are not permitted by law
to represent inventors before the Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a register of attorneys and
agents. To be admitted to this register, a person must comply with the
regulations prescribed by the Office, which require a showing that the
person is of good moral character and of good repute and that he/she
has the legal, and scientific and technical qualifications necessary to
render applicants for patents a valuable service. Certain of these qualifications
must be demonstrated by the passing of an examination.
Those admitted to the examination must have a college degree in
engineering or physical science or the equivalent of such a degree.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent and Trademark Office registers both attorneys at law and
persons who are not attorneys at law. The former persons are now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>referred to as “patent attorneys” and the latter persons are referred to
as “patent agents.” Insofar as the work of preparing an application for
a patent and conducting the prosecution in the Patent and Trademark
Office is concerned, patent agents are usually just as well qualified as
patent attorneys, although patent agents cannot conduct patent litigation
in the courts or perform various services which the local jurisdiction
considers as practicing law. For example, a patent agent could not
draw up a contract relating to a patent, such as an assignment or a
license, if the state in which he/she resides considers drafting contracts
as practicing law.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some individuals and organizations that are not registered advertise
their services in the fields of patent searching and invention marketing
and development. Such individuals and organizations cannot represent
inventors before the Patent and Trademark Office. They are not
subject to Patent and Trademark Office discipline, and the Office cannot
assist inventors in dealing with them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent and Trademark Office cannot recommend any particular
attorney or agent, or aid in the selection of an attorney or agent, as by
stating, in response to inquiry that a named patent attorney, agent, or
firm, is “reliable” or “capable.” The Patent and Trademark Office publishes
a directory of all registered patent attorneys and agents who
have indicated their availability to accept new clients, arranged by
states, cities, and foreign countries. The Directory may be purchased
in paper form from the Government Printing Office or from the PTO’s
Office of Electronic Information on the Cassis ASSIST CD-ROM disc. It
is also available on the PTO Web site.</p>

<p class='c004'>The telephone directories of most large cities have, in the classified
section, a heading for patent attorneys under which those in that area
are listed. Many large cities have associations of patent attorneys.</p>

<p class='c004'>In employing a patent attorney or agent, the inventor executes a
power of attorney or authorization of agent which must be filed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Patent and Trademark Office and is usually a part of the application
papers. When an attorney or agent has been appointed, the Office
does not communicate with the inventor directly but conducts the
correspondence with the attorney or agent since he/she is acting for
the inventor thereafter although the inventor is free to contact the
Patent and Trademark Office concerning the status of his/her application.
The inventor may remove the attorney or agent by revoking the
power of attorney or authorization of agent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Patent and Trademark Office has the power to disbar, or suspend
from practicing before it, persons guilty of gross misconduct, etc., but
this can only be done after a full hearing with the presentation of clear
and convincing evidence concerning the misconduct. The Patent and
Trademark Office will receive and, in appropriate cases, act upon
complaints against attorneys and agents. The fees charged to inventors
by patent attorneys and agents for their professional services are not
subject to regulation by the Patent and Trademark Office. Definite
evidence of overcharging may afford basis for Patent and Trademark
Office action, but the Office rarely intervenes in disputes concerning fees.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Disclosure Document</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One of the services provided for inventors is the acceptance and
preservation by the Patent and Trademark Office for a two year period
of papers signed by the inventor(s) disclosing an invention. This disclosure
is accepted as evidence of the dates of conception of the
invention. The Disclosure Document will be retained for two years and
then be destroyed unless it is referred to in a separate letter in a related
patent application within those two years.</p>

<p class='c004'>Disclosure Documents may also be filed at selected Patent and
Trademark Depository Libraries (PTDLs), presently including the
Sunnyvale (CA) Center for Innovation, Invention and Ideas and Great
Lakes Patent and Trademark Center at the Detroit (MI) Public Library.
A listing of PTDLs is included in this pamphlet under the heading
“Library, Search Room Searches and Patent and Trademark
Depository Libraries.” One copy of the document is kept at the PTDL
and the original documents are sent to the Patent and Trademark
Office for fee collection, processing and retention. Disclosure
Documents are kept in confidence by the PTO.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Disclosure Document is not a patent application and the date of
its receipt in the PTO does not become the effective filing date of any
patent application subsequently filed. The benefits provided by the
document will depend upon the adequacy of the disclosure and
therefore, it is recommended that the Disclosure Document be a clear
and complete explanation of the manner and process of making and
using the invention. When the nature of the invention permits, a drawing
or sketch should be included.</p>

<p class='c004'>A fee must accompany the disclosure. See the current fee schedule.
To facilitate the PTO’s electronic data capture and storage of the
Disclosure Document, it must be on white paper having dimensions
not to exceed 8½ x 11 inches (21.6 X 28.0 cm) with each page numbered.
Text and drawings must be sufficiently dark to permit reproduction
with commonly used office copying machines. Oversized papers,
even if foldable to the above dimensions will not be accepted.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Attachments such as videotapes and working models will not be
accepted and will be returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Disclosure Document must be accompanied by a separate signed
cover letter stating that it is submitted by, or on behalf of, the inventor(s)
and requesting that the material be received into the Disclosure
Document Program. The original submission will not be returned. A
notice with an identifying number and date of receipt in the PTO will
be mailed to the customer, indicating that the Disclosure Document
may be relied upon only as evidence and that a patent application
should be diligently filed if patent protection is desired.</p>

<p class='c004'>A brochure on Disclosure Documents is available by calling the PTO
General Information Services at 1–800–786–9199 or 703–308–4357.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Who May Apply for a Patent</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>According to the law, only the inventor may apply for a patent, with
certain exceptions. If a person who is not the inventor should apply for
a patent, the patent, if it were obtained, would be invalid. The person
applying in such a case who falsely states that he/she is the inventor
would also be subject to criminal penalties. If the inventor is dead, the
application may be made by legal representatives, that is, the administrator
or executor of the estate. If the inventor is insane, the application
for patent may be made by a guardian. If an inventor refuses to
apply for a patent or cannot be found, a joint inventor or a person having
a proprietary interest in the invention may apply on behalf of the
non-signing inventor.</p>

<p class='c004'>If two or more persons make an invention jointly, they apply for a
patent as joint inventors. A person who makes a financial contribution
is not a joint inventor and cannot be joined in the application as an
inventor. It is possible to correct an innocent mistake in erroneously
omitting an inventor or in erroneously naming a person as an inventor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Officers and employees of the Patent and Trademark Office are prohibited
by law from applying for a patent or acquiring, directly or indirectly,
except by inheritance or bequest, any patent or any right or
interest in any patent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Application For Patent</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>Non-Provisional Application for a Patent</h3>

<p class='c011'>A non-provisional application for a patent is made to the Assistant
Commissioner for Patents and includes:</p>

<p class='c004'>(1) A written document which comprises a specification (description
and claims), and an oath or declaration;</p>

<p class='c004'>(2) A drawing in those cases in which a drawing is necessary; and</p>

<p class='c004'>(3) The filing fee. See the fee schedule.</p>

<p class='c004'>All application papers must be in the English language or accompanied
by a verified translation into the English language along with the
required fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(k). All application papers must be
legibly written either by a typewriter or mechanical printer in permanent
dark ink or its equivalent in portrait orientation on flexible, strong,
smooth, non-shiny, durable and white paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>The papers must be presented in a form having sufficient clarity and
contrast between the paper and the writing to permit electronic reproduction.
The application papers must all be the same size—either 21.0
cm by 29.7 cm (DIN size A4) or 21.6 cm by 27.9 cm (8½ by 11 inches),
with a top margins of at least 2.0 cm (¾ inch), a left side margin
of at least 2.5 cm (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 2.0 cm (¾
inch) and a bottom margin of at least 2.0 cm (¾ inch) with no holes
made in the submitted papers. It is also required that the spacing on
all papers be 1½ or double spaced and the application papers must
be numbered consecutively (centrally located above or below the
text) starting with page one.</p>

<p class='c004'>The application for patent is not forwarded for examination until all
required parts, complying with the rules related thereto, are received.
If any application is filed without all the required parts for obtaining a
filing date (incomplete or defective), the applicant will be notified of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the deficiencies and given a time period to complete the application
filing (a surcharge may be required)—at which time a filing date as of
the date of such a completed submission will be obtained by the
applicant. If the omission is not corrected within a set, specified time
period, the application will be returned or otherwise disposed of; the
filing fee if submitted will be refunded less a handling fee as set forth
in the fee schedule.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is desirable that all parts of the complete application be deposited in
the Office together; otherwise each part must be signed and a letter
must accompany each part, accurately and clearly connecting it with
the other parts of the application.</p>

<p class='c004'>All applications received in the PTO are numbered in serial order and
the applicant will be informed of the application serial number and filing
date by a filing receipt.</p>

<p class='c004'>The filing date of an application for patent is the date on which the
names of the inventors, a specification (including claims) and any
required drawings are received in the PTO; or the date on which the
last part completing the application are received in the case of a previously
incomplete or defective application.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Provisional Application for a Patent</h3>

<p class='c011'>Since June 8, 1995, the PTO has offered inventors the option of filing a
provisional application for patent which was designed to provide a
lower cost first patent filing in the United States and to give U.S. applicants
parity with foreign applicants. Claims and oath or declaration are
NOT required for a provisional application. Provisional application provides
the means to establish an early effective filing date in a patent
application and permits the term “Patent Pending” to be applied in
connection with the invention. Provisional applications may not be
filed for design inventions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The filing date of a provisional application is the date on which a written
description of the invention, drawings if necessary, and the name
of the inventor(s) are received in the PTO. To be complete, a provisional
application must also include the filing fee, and a cover sheet
specifying that the application is a provisional application for patent.
Applicant would then have up to twelve months to file a non-provisional
application for patent as described above. The claimed subject
matter in the later filed non-provisional application is entitled to the
benefit of the filing date of the provisional application if it has support
in the provisional application.</p>

<p class='c004'>Provisional applications are not examined on their merits. A provisional
application will become abandoned by the operation of law twelve
months from its filing date. The twelve month pendency for a provisional
application is not counted toward the 20 year term of a patent
granted on a subsequently filed non-provisional application which
relies on the filing date of the provisional application.</p>

<p class='c004'>A surcharge is required for filing the basic filing fee or the cover sheet
on a date later than the filing of the provisional application.</p>

<p class='c004'>A brochure on Provisional Application for Patent is available by calling
the PTO General Information Services at 1–800–786–9199 or 703–308–4357
or by accessing PTO’s Web site at <i>http://www.uspto.gov</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Oath or Declaration, Signature</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The oath or declaration of the applicant is required by law for a non-provisional
application. The inventor must make an oath or declaration
that he/she believes himself/herself to be the original and first inventor
of the subject matter of the application, and he/she must make various
other allegations required by law and various allegations required
by the Patent and Trademark Office rules. The oath must be sworn to
by the inventor before a notary public or other officer authorized to
administer oaths. A declaration may be used in lieu of an oath as part
of the original application for a patent involving designs, plants, and
other patentable inventions; for reissue patents; when claiming matter
originally shown or described but not originally claimed; or when filing
a divisional or continuing application. A declaration does not need to
be notarized.</p>

<p class='c004'>The oath or declaration must be signed by the inventor in person, or
by the person entitled by law to make application on the inventor’s
behalf. A full first and last name with middle initial or name, if any, of
each inventor are required. The post office address and citizenship of
each inventor are also required.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sample forms are available by calling the PTO General Information
Services at 800–786–9199 or 703–308–4357 or by accessing PTO Web site
at <i>http://www.uspto.gov</i> under the section titled “PTO Forms.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The papers in a complete application will not be returned for any purpose
whatsoever, nor will the filing fee be returned. If applicants have not
preserved copies of the papers, the Office will furnish copies for a fee.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Please Note: The fees are current as of the revision date. Fees are
subject to change in October of each year and should therefore be
verified before submission to the PTO. A fee schedule may be obtained
by writing to Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington,
D.C. 20231—Attention: General Information Services or by calling the
General Information Services at 800–786–9199 or 703–308–4357 or from
the PTO Web site at <i>http://www.uspto.gov</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The filing fee of a non-provisional application, except in design and
plant cases, consists of a basic fee and additional fees. The basic fee
entitles the applicant to present twenty (20) claims, including not
more than three (3) in independent form. An additional fee is required
for each claim in independent form which is in excess of three (3)
and an additional fee is required for each claim (whether independent
or dependent) which is in excess of a total of twenty (20) claims. If the
application contains multiple dependent claims, additional fees are
required.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the owner of the invention is a small entity, (an independent inventor,
a small business concern or a non-profit organization), the filing
fees are reduced by half if the small entity files a verified statement
claiming small entity status.</p>

<p class='c004'>To avoid errors in the payment of fees it is suggested that the table in
the enclosed patent application transmittal letter be utilized to calculate
the fee payment.</p>

<p class='c004'>In calculating fees, a claim is in singularly dependent form if it incorporates
by reference a single preceding claim which may be an independent
or a dependent claim. A multiple dependent claim or any
claim depending therefrom shall be considered as separate dependent
claims in accordance with the number of claims to which reference
is made.</p>

<p class='c004'>The law also provides for the payment of additional fees on presentation
of additional claims after the application is filed. When an amendment
is filed which presents additional claims over the total number
already paid for, or additional independent claims over the number of
independent claims already accounted for, it must be accompanied
by any additional fees due.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following order of arrangement should be observed in framing
the application:</p>

<p class='c004'>(a) Application transmittal form.</p>

<p class='c004'>(b) Fee transmittal form.</p>

<p class='c004'>(c) Title of the Invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>(d) Cross Reference to related applications (if any).</p>

<p class='c004'>(e) Statement of federally sponsored research/development (if any).</p>

<p class='c004'>(g) Background of the Invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>(h) Brief Summary of the Invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>(i) Brief description of the several views of the drawing (if any).</p>

<p class='c004'>(j) Detailed Description of the Invention.</p>

<p class='c004'>(o) Sequence listing (if any).</p>

<p class='c004'>(p) Plant Color Coding Sheet (applicable in plant patent applications).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The specification must include a written description of the invention
and of the manner and process of making and using it, and is required
to be in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person
skilled in the technological area to which the invention pertains,
or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specification must set forth the precise invention for which a
patent is solicited, in such manner as to distinguish it from other
inventions and from what is old. It must describe completely a specific
embodiment of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of
matter, or improvement invented, and must explain the mode of operation
or principle whenever applicable. The best mode contemplated
by the inventor for carrying out the invention must be set forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the case of an improvement, the specification must particularly
point out the part or parts of the process, machine, manufacture, or
composition of matter to which the improvement relates, and the
description should be confined to the specific improvement and to
such parts as necessarily cooperate with it or as may be necessary to
a complete understanding or description of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The title of the invention, which should be as short and specific as
possible, should appear as a heading on the first page of the specification,
if it does not otherwise appear at the beginning of the application.</p>

<p class='c004'>A brief abstract of the technical disclosure in the specification including
that which is new in the art to which the invention pertains, must
be set forth on a separate page immediately following the claims. The
abstract should be in the form of a single paragraph of 250 words or
less, under the heading “Abstract of the Disclosure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A brief summary of the invention indicating its nature and substance,
which may include a statement of the object of the invention should
precede the detailed description. The summary should be commensurate
with the invention as claimed and any object recited should be
that of the invention as claimed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>When there are drawings, there shall be a brief description of the several
views of the drawings, and the detailed description of the invention
shall refer to the different views by specifying the numbers of the
figures, and to the different parts by use of reference numerals.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specification must conclude with a claim or claims particularly
pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant
regards as the invention. The portion of the application in which
the applicant sets forth the claim or claims is an important part of the
application, as it is the claims that define the scope of the protection
afforded by the patent and which questions of infringement are
judged by the courts.</p>

<p class='c004'>More than one claim may be presented provided they differ substantially
from each other and are not unduly multiplied. One or more
claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and
further limiting another claim or claims in the same application. Any
dependent claim which refers back to more than one other claim is
considered a “multiple dependent claim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Multiple dependent claims shall refer to such other claims in the alternative
only. A multiple dependent claim shall not serve as a basis for
any other multiple dependent claim. Claims in dependent form shall
be construed to include all of the limitations of the claim incorporated
by reference into the dependent claim. A multiple dependent claim
shall be construed to incorporate all the limitations of each of the particular
claims in relation to which it is being considered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The claim or claims must conform to the invention as set forth in the
remainder of the specification and the terms and phrases used in the
claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description
so that the meaning of the terms in the claims may be ascertainable
by reference to the description.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Drawing</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The applicant for a patent will be required by law to furnish a drawing
of the invention whenever the nature of the case requires a drawing to
understand the invention. However, the Commissioner may require a
drawing where the nature of the subject matter admits of it; this drawing
must be filed with the application. This includes practically all
inventions except compositions of matter or processes, but a drawing
may also be useful in the case of many processes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the
claims, and is required by the Office rules to be in a particular form.
The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is
made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the
making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in
detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style
when the patent issues, and the drawings must also be such that they
can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions.</p>

<p class='c004'>No names or other identification will be permitted within the “sight” of
the drawing, and applicants are expected to use the space above and
between the hole locations to identify each sheet of drawings. This
identification may consist of the attorney’s name and docket number
or the inventor’s name and case number and may include the sheet
number and the total number of sheets filed (for example, “sheet 2 of
4”). The following rule, reproduced from title 37 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, relates to the standards for drawings:</p>

<h3 class='c010'>§ 1.84 Standards for drawings.</h3>

<p class='c011'>(a) <strong>Drawings.</strong> There are two acceptable categories for presenting
drawings in utility patent applications:</p>

<p class='c004'>(1) <i>Black ink.</i> Black and white drawings are normally required. India
ink, or its equivalent that secures solid black lines, must be used for
drawings, or</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>(2) <i>Color.</i> On rare occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the
only practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter sought
to be patented in a utility patent application or the subject matter of a
statutory invention registration. The Patent and Trademark Office will
accept color drawings in utility patent applications and statutory invention
registrations only after granting a petition filed under this paragraph
explaining why the color drawings are necessary. Any such petition
must include the following:</p>

<p class='c004'>(i) The appropriate fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(h);</p>

<p class='c004'>(ii) Three (3) sets of color drawings; and</p>

<p class='c004'>(iii) The specification must contain the following language as the first
paragraph in that portion of the specification relating to the brief
description of the drawing:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i>The file of this patent contains at least one drawing executed in
color. Copies of this patent with color drawing(s) will be provided by
the Patent and Trademark Office upon request and payment of the
necessary fee.</i>”</p>

<p class='c004'>If the language is not in the specification, a proposed amendment to
insert the language must accompany the petition.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>(b) <strong>Photographs.</strong></h3>

<p class='c011'>(1) <i>Black and white.</i> Photographs are not ordinarily permitted in utility
and design patent applications. However, the Office will accept photographs
in utility and design patent applications only after granting a
petition filed under this paragraph which requests that photographs be
accepted. Any such petition must include the following:</p>

<p class='c004'>(i) The appropriate fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(h); and</p>

<p class='c004'>(ii) Three (3) sets of photographs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Photographs must either be developed on double weight photographic
paper or be permanently mounted on Bristol board. The
photographs must be of sufficient quality so that all details in the
drawing are reproducible in the printed patent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>(2) <i>Color.</i> Color photographs will be accepted in utility patent applications
if the conditions for accepting color drawings have been satisfied.
See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class='c004'>(c) <strong>Identification of drawings.</strong> Identifying indicia, if provided, should
include the application number or the title of the invention, inventor’s
name, docket number (if any), and the name and telephone number
of a person to call if the Office is unable to match the drawings to the
proper application. This information should be placed on the back of
each sheet of drawings a minimum distance of 1.5 cm. (⅝ inch)
down from the top of the page. In addition, a reference to the application
number, or, if an application number has not been assigned, the
inventor’s name, may be included in the left-hand corner provided
that the reference appears within 1.5 cm. (<span class='fraction'>9<br /><span class='vincula'>16</span></span> inch) from the top of
the sheet.</p>

<p class='c004'>(d) <strong>Graphic forms in drawings.</strong> Chemical or mathematical formulae,
tables, and waveforms may be submitted as drawings and are subject
to the same requirements as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical
formula must be labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when
necessary, to show that information is properly integrated. Each group
of waveforms must be presented as a single figure, using a common
vertical axis with time extending along the horizontal axis. Each individual
waveform discussed in the specification must be identified with a
separate letter designation adjacent to the vertical axis.</p>

<p class='c004'>(e) <strong>Type of paper.</strong> Drawings submitted to the Office must be made
on paper which is flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and
durable. All sheets must be free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only
one side of the sheet shall be used for the drawing. Each sheet must
be reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations,
overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must either be developed
on double weight photographic paper or be permanently mounted on
Bristol board. See paragraph (b) of this section for other requirements
for photographs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>(f) <strong>Size of paper.</strong> All drawing sheets in an application must be the
same size. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top.
The size of the sheets on which drawings are made must be:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(1) 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or</div>
      <div class='line'>(2) 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8½ by 11 inches).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>(g) <strong>Margins.</strong> The sheets must not contain frames around the sight;
i.e., the usable surface, but should have scan target points, i.e., cross-hairs,
printed on two catercorner margin corners. Each sheet must
include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a left side margin of at
least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 1.5 cm. (<span class='fraction'>9<br /><span class='vincula'>16</span></span> inch),
and a bottom margin of at least 1.0 cm. (⅜ inch), thereby leaving a
sight no greater than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm.
(DIN size A4) drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm. by
24.4 cm. (6<span class='fraction'>15<br /><span class='vincula'>16</span></span> by 9⅝ inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8½ by 11
inch) drawing sheets.</p>

<p class='c004'>(h) <strong>Views.</strong> The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to
show the invention. The views may be plan, elevation, section, or perspective
views. Detail views of portions of elements, on a larger scale
if necessary, may also be used. All views of the drawing must be
grouped together and arranged on the sheet(s) without wasting space,
preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another,
and must not be included in the sheets containing the specifications,
claims, or abstract. Views must not be connected by projection lines
and must not contain center lines. Waveforms of electrical signals may
be connected by dashed lines to show the relative timing of the waveforms.</p>

<p class='c004'>(1) <i>Exploded views.</i> Exploded views, with the separated parts
embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly
of various parts are permissible. When an exploded view is shown in
a figure which is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded
view should be placed in brackets.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>(2) <i>Partial views.</i> When necessary, a view of a large machine or
device in its entirety may be broken into partial views on a single
sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss in facility of
understanding the view. Partial views drawn on separate sheets must
always be capable of being linked edge to edge so that no partial view
contains parts of another partial view. A smaller scale view should be
included showing the whole formed by the partial views and indicating
the positions of the parts shown. When a portion of a view is enlarged
for magnification purposes, the view and the enlarged view must each
be labeled as separate views.</p>

<p class='c004'>(i) Where views on two or more sheets form, in effect, a single complete
view, the views on the several sheets must be so arranged that
the complete figure can be assembled without concealing any part of
any of the views appearing on the various sheets.</p>

<p class='c004'>(ii) A very long view may be divided into several parts placed one
above the other on a single sheet. However, the relationship between
the different parts must be clear and unambiguous.</p>

<p class='c004'>(3) <i>Sectional views.</i> The plane upon which a sectional view is taken
should be indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a
broken line. The ends of the broken line should be designated by
Arabic or Roman numerals corresponding to the view number of the
sectional view, and should have arrows to indicate the direction of
sight. Hatching must be used to indicate section portions of an object,
and must be made by regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced
sufficiently apart to enable the lines to be distinguished without difficulty.
Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the reference
characters and lead lines. If it is not possible to place reference characters
outside the hatched area, the hatching may be broken off wherever
reference characters are inserted. Hatching must be at a substantial angle
to the surrounding axes or principal lines, preferably 45°. A cross section
must be set out and drawn to show all of the materials as they are
shown in the view from which the cross section was taken. The parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in cross section must show proper material(s) by hatching with regularly
spaced parallel oblique strokes, the space between strokes being
chosen on the basis of the total area to be hatched. The various parts
of a cross section of the same item should be hatched in the same
manner and should accurately and graphically indicate the nature of
the material(s) that is illustrated in cross section. The hatching of juxtaposed
different elements must be angled in a different way. In the
case of large areas, hatching may be confined to an edging drawn
around the entire inside of the outline of the area to be hatched.
Different types of hatching should have different conventional meanings
as regards the nature of a material seen in cross section.</p>

<p class='c004'>(4) <i>Alternate position.</i> A moved position may be shown by a broken line
superimposed upon a suitable view if this can be done without crowding;
otherwise, a separate view must be used for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>(5) <i>Modified forms.</i> Modified forms of construction must be shown in
separate views.</p>

<p class='c004'>(i) <strong>Arrangement of views.</strong> One view must not be placed upon another
or within the outline of another. All views on the same sheet should
stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand so that they can be
read with the sheet held in an upright position. If views wider than the
width of the sheet are necessary for the clearest illustration of the
invention, the sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the
sheet, with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading
space, is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal,
left-to-right fashion when the page is either upright or turned so that
the top becomes the right side, except for graphs utilizing standard scientific
convention to denote the axis of abscissas (of X) and the axis of
ordinates (of Y).</p>

<p class='c004'>(j) <strong>View for Official Gazette.</strong> One of the views should be suitable for
publication in the Official Gazette as the illustration of the invention.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>(k) <strong>Scale.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>(1) The scale to which a drawing is made must be large enough to
show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced
in size to two-thirds in reproduction. Views of portions of the mechanism
on a larger scale should be used when necessary to show details
clearly. Two or more sheets may be used if one does not give sufficient
room. The number of sheets should be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c004'>(2) When approved by the examiner, the scale of the drawing may be
graphically represented. Indications such as “actual size” or “scale
½” on the drawings, are not permitted, since these lose their meaning
with reproduction in a different format.</p>

<p class='c004'>(3) Elements of the same view must be in proportion to each other,
unless a difference in proportion is indispensable for the clarity of the
view. Instead of showing elements in different proportion, a supplementary
view may be added giving a larger-scale illustration of the
element of the initial view. The enlarged element shown in the second
view should be surrounded by a finely drawn or “dot-dash” circle in
the first view indicating its location without obscuring the view.</p>

<p class='c004'>(l) <strong>Character of lines, numbers, and letters.</strong> All drawings must be
made by a process which will give them satisfactory reproduction
characteristics. Every line, number, and letter must be durable, clean,
black (except for color drawings), sufficiently dense and dark, and
uniformly thick and well-defined. The weight of all lines and letters
must be heavy enough to permit adequate reproduction. This requirement
applies to all lines however fine, to shading, and to lines representing
cut surfaces in sectional views. Lines and strokes of different
thicknesses may be used in the same drawing where different thicknesses
have a different meaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>(m) <strong>Shading.</strong> The use of shading in views is encouraged if it aids in
understanding the invention and if it does not reduce legibility. Shading is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>used to indicate the surface or shape of spherical, cylindrical, and
conical elements of an object. Flat parts may also be lightly shaded.
Such shading is preferred in the case of parts shown in perspective,
but not for cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Spaced
lines for shading are preferred. These lines must be thin, as few in
number as practicable, and they must contrast with the rest of the
drawings. As a substitute for shading, heavy lines on the shade side of
objects can be used except where they superimpose on each other or
obscure reference characters. Light should come from the upper left
corner at an angle of 45°. Surface delineations should preferably be
shown by proper shading. Solid black shading areas are not permitted,
except when used to represent bar graphs or color.</p>

<p class='c004'>(n) <strong>Symbols.</strong> Graphical drawing symbols may be used for conventional
elements when appropriate. The elements for which such symbols
and labeled representations are used must be adequately identified
in the specification. Known devices should be illustrated by symbols
which have a universally recognized conventional meaning and
are generally accepted in the art. Other symbols which are not universally
recognized may be used, subject to approval by the Office, if they
are not likely to be confused with existing conventional symbols, and if
they are readily identifiable.</p>

<p class='c004'>(o) <strong>Legends.</strong> Suitable descriptive legends may be used, or may be
required by the Examiner, where necessary for understanding of the
drawing, subject to approval by the Office. They should contain as few
words as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>(p) <strong>Numbers, Letters, and reference characters.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>(1) Reference characters (numerals are preferred), sheet numbers,
and view numbers must be plain and legible, and must not be used in
association with brackets or inverted commas, or enclosed within outlines,
e.g., encircled. They must be oriented in the same direction as
the view so as to avoid having to rotate the sheet. Reference characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>should be arranged to follow the profile of the object depicted.</p>

<p class='c004'>(2) The English alphabet must be used for letters, except where
another alphabet is customarily used, such as the Greek alphabet to
indicate angles, wavelengths, and mathematical formulas.</p>

<p class='c004'>(3) Numbers, letters, and reference characters must measure at least
.32 cm. (⅛ inch) in height. They should not be placed in the drawing
so as to interfere with its comprehension. Therefore, they should not
cross or mingle with the lines. They should not be placed upon
hatched or shaded surfaces. When necessary, such as indicating a
surface or cross section, a reference character may be underlined and
a blank space may be left in the hatching or shading where the character
occurs so that it appears distinct.</p>

<p class='c004'>(4) The same part of an invention appearing in more than one view of
the drawing must always be designated by the same reference character,
and the same reference character must never be used to designate
different parts.</p>

<p class='c004'>(5) Reference characters not mentioned in the description shall not
appear in the drawings. Reference characters mentioned in the
description must appear in the drawings.</p>

<p class='c004'>(q) Lead lines. Lead lines are those lines between the reference characters
and the details referred to. Such lines may be straight or curved
and should be as short as possible. They must originate in the immediate
proximity of the reference character and extend to the feature
indicated. Lead lines must not cross each other. Lead lines are
required for each reference character except for those which indicate
the surface or cross section on which they are placed. Such a reference
character must be underlined to make it clear that a lead line
has not been left out by mistake. Lead lines must be executed in the
same way as lines in the drawing. See paragraph (1) of this section.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>(r) <strong>Arrows.</strong> Arrows may be used at the ends of lines, provided that
their meaning is clear, as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>(1) On a lead line, a freestanding arrow to indicate the entire section
towards which it points;</p>

<p class='c004'>(2) On a lead line, an arrow touching a line to indicate the surface
shown by the line looking along the direction of the arrow; or</p>

<p class='c004'>(3) To show the direction of movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>(s) <strong>Copyright or Mask Work Notice.</strong> A copyright or mask work
notice may appear in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight
of the drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright
or mask work material and be limited to letters having a print
size of .32 cm. to .64 cm. (⅛ to ¼ inches) high. The content of the
notice must be limited to only those elements provided for by law. For
example, “e1983 John Doe” (17 U.S.C. 401) and “*M* John Doe” (17
U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current statutes,
legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work, respectively.
Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be permitted only if
the authorization language set forth in w 1.71(e) is included at the
beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.</p>

<p class='c004'>(t) <strong>Numbering of sheets of drawings.</strong> The sheets of drawings
should be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1,
within the sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These
numbers, if present, must be placed in the middle of the top of the
sheet, but not in the margin. The numbers can be placed on the right-hand
side if the drawing extends too close to the middle of the top
edge of the usable surface. The drawing sheet numbering must be
clear and larger than the numbers used as reference characters to
avoid confusion. The number of each sheet should be shown by two
Arabic numerals placed on either side of an oblique line, with the first
being the sheet number and the second being the total number of
sheets of drawings, with no other marking.</p>

<p class='c004'>(u) <strong>Numbering of views.</strong></p>

<p class='c004'>(1) The different views must be numbered in consecutive Arabic
numerals, starting with 1, independent of the numbering of the sheets
and, if possible, in the order in which they appear on the drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>sheet(s). Partial views intended to form one complete view, on one or
several sheets, must be identified by the same number followed by a
capital letter. View numbers must be preceded by the abbreviation
“FIG.” Where only a single view is used in an application to illustrate
the claimed invention, it must not be numbered and the abbreviation
“FIG.” must not appear.</p>

<p class='c004'>(2) Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple and
clear and must not be used in association with brackets, circles, or
inverted commas. The view numbers must be larger than the numbers
used for reference characters.</p>

<p class='c004'>(v) <strong>Security markings.</strong> Authorized security markings may be placed
on the drawings provided they are outside the sight, preferably centered
in the top margin.</p>

<p class='c004'>(w) <strong>Corrections.</strong> Any corrections on drawings submitted to the Office
must be durable and permanent.</p>

<p class='c004'>(x) <strong>Holes.</strong> No holes should be made by applicant in the drawing
sheets.</p>

<p class='c004'>The requirements relating to drawings are strictly enforced, but a
drawing not complying with all of the regulations may be accepted for
purpose of examination, and correction or a new drawing will be
required later.</p>

<p class='c004'>Applicants are advised to employ competent draftsmen to make their
drawings.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Models, Exhibits, Specimens</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Models are not required in most patent applications since the description
of the invention in the specification and the drawings must be sufficiently
full, clear, and complete and capable of being understood to
disclose the invention without the aid of a model. A model will not be
admitted unless specifically requested by the examiner.</p>

<p class='c004'>A working model, or other physical exhibit, may be required by the
Office if deemed necessary. This is not done very often. A working
model may be requested in the case of applications for patent for
alleged perpetual motion devices.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the invention relates to a composition of matter, the applicant
may be required to furnish specimens of the composition, or of its
ingredients or intermediates, for inspection or experiment. If the
invention is a microbiological invention, a deposit of the micro-organism
involved is required.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Examination of Applications and Proceedings in the Patent and Trademark Office</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Applications, other than provisional applications, filed in the Patent
and Trademark Office and accepted as complete applications are
assigned for examination to the respective examining groups having
charge of the areas of technology related to the invention. In the
examining group, applications are taken up for examination by the
examiner to whom they have been assigned in the order in which
they have been filed or in accordance with examining procedures
established by the Commissioner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Applications will not be advanced out of turn for examination or for
further action except as provided by the rules, or upon order of the
Commissioner to expedite the business of the Office, or upon a verified
showing which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, will justify
advancing them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The examination of the application consists of a study of the application
for compliance with the legal requirements and a search through
United States patents, foreign patent documents, and available literature,
to see if the claimed invention is new and nonobvious. A decision
is reached by the examiner in the light of the study and the result
of the search.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a result of the examination by the Office, patents are granted in the
case of about two out of every three applications for patents which
are filed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Office Action</h3>

<p class='c011'>The applicant is notified in writing of the examiner’s decision by an
“action” which is normally mailed to the attorney or agent of record.
The reasons for any adverse action or any objection or requirement
are stated in the action and such information or references are given
as may be useful in aiding the applicant to judge the propriety of continuing
the prosecution of his/her application.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>If the claimed invention is not directed to patentable subject matter,
the claims will be rejected. If the examiner finds that the claimed
invention lacks novelty or differs only in an obvious manner from what
is found in the prior art, the claims may also be rejected. It is not
uncommon for some or all of the claims to be rejected on the first
office action by the examiner, relatively few applications are allowed
as filed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Applicant’s Response</h3>

<p class='c011'>The applicant must request reconsideration in writing, and must distinctly
and specifically point out the supposed errors in the examiner’s
action. The applicant must respond to every ground of objection and
rejection in the prior Office action (except that a request may be
made that objections or requirements as to form not necessary to further
consideration of the claims be held in abeyance until allowable
subject matter is indicated). The applicant’s action must appear
throughout to be a bona fide attempt to advance the case to final
action. The mere allegation that the examiner has erred will not be
received as a proper reason for such reconsideration.</p>

<p class='c004'>In amending an application in response to a rejection, the applicant
must clearly point out why he/she thinks the amended claims are
patentable in view of the state of the art disclosed by the prior references
cited or the objections made. He/she must also show how the
claims as amended avoid such references or objections.</p>

<p class='c004'>After response by the applicant the application will be reconsidered,
and the applicant will be notified as to the status of the claims, that is,
whether the claims are rejected, or objected to, or whether the claims
are allowed, in the same manner as after the first examination. The
second Office action usually will be made final.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>Final Rejection</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On the second or later consideration, the rejection or other action may
be made final. The applicant’s response is then limited to appeal in
the case of rejection of any claim and further amendment is restricted.
Petition may be taken to the Commissioner in the case of objections
or requirements not involved in the rejection of any claim. Response
to a final rejection or action must include cancellation of, or appeal
from the rejection of, each claim so rejected and, if any claim stands
allowed, compliance with any requirement or objection as to form.</p>

<p class='c004'>In making such final rejection, the examiner repeats or states all
grounds of rejection then considered applicable to the claims in the
application.</p>

<p class='c004'>Interviews with examiners may be arranged, but an interview does
not remove the necessity for response to Office actions within the
required time, and the action of the Office is based solely on the written
record.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Restrictions</h3>

<p class='c011'>If two or more inventions are claimed in a single application, and are
regarded by the Office to be of such a nature that a single patent
should not be issued for both of them, the applicant will be required
to limit the application to one of the inventions. The other invention
may be made the subject of a separate application which, if filed
while the first application is still pending, will be entitled to the benefit
of the filing date of the first application. A requirement to restrict the
application to one invention may be made before further action by the
examiner.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Amendments to Application</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Following are some details concerning amendments to the application:</p>

<p class='c004'>The applicant may amend before or after the first examination and
action as specified in the rules, or when and as specifically required
by the examiner.</p>

<p class='c004'>After final rejection or action, amendments may be made canceling
claims or complying with any requirement of form which has been
made but the admission of any such amendment or its refusal, and
any proceedings relative thereto, shall not operate to relieve the application
from its condition as subject to appeal or to save it from abandonment.</p>

<p class='c004'>If amendments touching the merits of the application are presented
after final rejection, or after appeal has been taken, or when such
amendment might not otherwise be proper, they may be admitted
upon a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they are necessary
and were not earlier presented.</p>

<p class='c004'>No amendment can be made as a matter of right in appealed cases.
After decision on appeal, amendments can only be made as provided
in the rules.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specifications, claims, and drawing must be amended and
revised when required, to correct inaccuracies of description and definition
or unnecessary words, and to secure correspondence between
the claims, the description, and the drawing.</p>

<p class='c004'>All amendments of the drawings or specifications, and all additions
thereto must not include new matter beyond the original disclosure.
Matter not found in either, involving a departure from or an addition to
the original disclosure, cannot be added to the application even
though supported by a supplemental oath or declaration, and can be
shown or claimed only in a separate application.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The claims may be amended by canceling particular claims, by presenting
new claims, or by amending the language of particular claims
(such amended claims being in effect new claims). In presenting new
or amended claims, the applicant must point out how they avoid any
reference or ground rejection of record which may be pertinent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Erasures, additions, insertions, or alterations of the papers and records
must not be made by the applicant. Amendments are made by filing a
paper, directing or requesting that specified changes or additions be
made. The exact word or words to be stricken out or inserted in the
application must be specified and the precise point indicated where
the deletion or insertion is to be made.</p>

<p class='c004'>Amendments are “entered” by the Office by making the proposed
deletions by drawing a line in red ink through the word or words canceled
and by making the proposed substitutions or insertions in red
ink. Small insertions are written in at the designated place and larger
insertions are indicated by reference.</p>

<p class='c004'>No change in the drawing may be made except by permission of the
Office. Changes in the construction shown in any drawing may be
made only by submitting new drawings. A sketch in permanent ink
showing proposed changes, to become part of the record, must be
filed for approval by the Office before the new drawings are filed. The
paper requesting amendments to the drawing should be separate
from other papers.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the number or nature of the amendments render it difficult to consider
the case, or to arrange the papers for printing or copying, the
examiner may require the entire specification or claims, or any part
thereof, to be rewritten.</p>

<p class='c004'>The original numbering of the claims must be preserved throughout
the prosecution. When claims are canceled, the remaining claims
must not be renumbered. When claims are added by amendment or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>substituted for canceled claims, they must be numbered by the applicant
consecutively beginning with the number next following the highest
numbered claim previously presented. When the application is
ready for allowance, the examiner, if necessary, will renumber the
claims consecutively in the order in which they appear or in such
order as may have been requested by applicant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Time for Response and Abandonment</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The response of an applicant to an action by the Office must be made
within a prescribed time limit. The maximum period for response is
set at 6 months by the statute which also provides that the
Commissioner may shorten the time for reply to not less than 30 days.
The usual period for response to an Office action is 3 months. A shortened
time for reply may be extended up to the maximum 6–month
period. An extension of time fee is normally required to be paid if the
response period is extended. The amount of the fee is dependent
upon the length of the extension. If no reply is received within the
time period, the application is considered as abandoned and no
longer pending. However, if it can be shown that the failure to prosecute
was unavoidable or unintentional, the application may be revived
by the Commissioner. The revival requires a petition to the
Commissioner, and a fee for the petition, which should be filed without
delay. The proper response must also accompany the petition if it
has not yet been filed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and to the Courts</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If the examiner persists in the rejection of any of the claims in an
application, or if the rejection has been made final, the applicant may
appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in the Patent
and Trademark Office. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
consists of the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, the Deputy
Commissioner, the Assistant Commissioners, and the administrative
patent judges, but normally each appeal is heard by only three members.
An appeal fee is required and the applicant must file a brief to
support his/her position. An oral hearing will be held if requested upon
payment of the specified fee.</p>

<p class='c004'>As an alternative to appeal, in situations where an applicant desires
consideration of different claims or further evidence, a new continuation
application is often filed. The new application requires a filing fee
and should submit the claims and evidence for which consideration is
desired. If it is filed before expiration of the period for appeal and specific
reference is made therein to the earlier application, applicant will
be entitled to the earlier filing date for subject matter common to both
applications.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences is still
adverse to the applicant, an appeal may be taken to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a civil action may be filed against the
Commissioner in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will review the
record made in the Office and may affirm or reverse the Office’s
action. In a civil action, the applicant may present testimony in the
court, and the court will make a decision.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Interferences</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Occasionally two or more applications are filed by different inventors
claiming substantially the same patentable invention. The patent can
only be granted to one of them, and a proceeding known as an “interference”
is instituted by the Office to determine who is the first inventor
and entitled to the patent. About one percent of the applications
filed become involved in an interference proceeding. Interference proceedings
may also be instituted between an application and a patent
already issued, provided the patent has not been issued for more than
one year prior to the filing of the conflicting application, and provided
that the conflicting application is not barred from being patentable for
some other reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each party to such a proceeding must submit evidence of facts proving
when the invention was made. In view of the necessity of proving
the various facts and circumstances concerning the making of the
invention during an interference, inventors must be able to produce
evidence to do this. If no evidence is submitted a party is restricted to
the date of filing the application as his/her earliest date. The priority
question is determined by a board of three administrative patent
judges on the evidence submitted. From the decision of the Board of
Patent Appeals and Interferences, the losing party may appeal to the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or file a civil action against the
winning party in the appropriate United States district court.</p>

<p class='c004'>The terms “conception of the invention” and “reduction to practice”
are encountered in connection with priority questions. Conception of
the invention refers to the completion of the devising of the means for
accomplishing the result. Reduction to practice refers to the actual
construction of the invention in physical form: in the case of a
machine it includes the actual building of the machine, in the case of
an article or composition it includes the actual making of the article or
composition, in the case of a process it includes the actual carrying
out of the steps of the process. Actual operation, demonstration, or
testing for the intended use is also usually necessary. The filing of a
regular application for patent completely disclosing the invention is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>treated as equivalent to reduction to practice. The inventor who
proves to be the first to conceive the invention and the first to reduce
it to practice will be held to be the prior inventor, but more complicated
situations cannot be stated this simply.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Allowance and Issue of Patent</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If, on examination of the application, or at a later stage during the
reconsideration of the application, the patent application is found to
be allowable, a notice of allowance will be sent to the applicant, or to
applicant’s attorney or agent of record, if any, and a fee for issuing the
patent is due within three months from the date of the notice. If timely
payment of the issue fee is not made, the application will be regarded
as abandoned. See current fee schedule.</p>

<p class='c004'>A provision is made in the statute whereby the Commissioner may
accept the fee late, when the delay is shown to be unavoidable. When
the issue fee is paid, the patent issues as soon as possible after the
date of payment, dependent upon the volume of printing on hand.
The patent grant then is delivered or mailed on the day of its grant, or
as soon thereafter as possible, to the inventor’s attorney or agent if
there is one of record, otherwise directly to the inventor. On the date
of the grant, the patent file becomes open to the public. Printed copies
of the specification and drawing are available on the same date.</p>

<p class='c004'>In case the publication of an invention by the granting of a patent
would be detrimental to the national defense, the patent law gives the
Commissioner the power to withhold the grant of the patent and to
order the invention kept secret for such period of time as the national
interest requires.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Nature of Patent and Patent Rights</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The patent is issued in the name of the United States under the seal of
the Patent and Trademark Office, and is either signed by the
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks or has his name written
thereon and attested by an Office official. The patent contains a grant
to the patentee, and a printed copy of the specification and drawing is
annexed to the patent and forms a part of it. The grant confers “the
right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale or selling
the invention throughout the United States or importing the invention
into the United States” and its territories and possessions for which the
term of the patent shall be 20 years from the date on which the application
for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the application
contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application under
35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c), from the date of the earliest such application
was filed, and subject to the payment of maintenance fees as provided
by law.</p>

<p class='c004'>The exact nature of the right conferred must be carefully distinguished,
and the key is in the words “right to exclude” in the phrase
just quoted. The patent does not grant the right to make, use, offer for
sale or sell or import the invention but only grants the exclusive nature
of the right. Any person is ordinarily free to make, use, offer for sale or
sell or import anything he/she pleases, and a grant from the
Government is not necessary. The patent only grants the right to
exclude others from making, using, offering for sale or selling or
importing the invention. Since the patent does not grant the right to
make, use, offer for sale, or sell, or import the invention, the patentee’s
own right to do so is dependent upon the rights of others and
whatever general laws might be applicable. A patentee, merely
because he/she has received a patent for an invention, is not thereby
authorized to make, use, offer for sale, or sell, or import the invention
if doing so would violate any law. An inventor of a new automobile
who has obtained a patent thereon would not be entitled to use the
patented automobile in violation of the laws of a State requiring a
license, nor may a patentee sell an article, the sale of which may be
forbidden by a law, merely because a patent has been obtained.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Neither may a patentee make, use, offer for sale, or sell, or import
his/her own invention if doing so would infringe the prior rights of others.
A patentee may not violate the Federal antitrust laws, such as by
resale price agreements or entering into combination in restraints of
trade, or the pure food and drug laws, by virtue of having a patent.
Ordinarily there is nothing which prohibits a patentee from making,
using, offering for sale, or selling, or importing his/her own invention,
unless he/she thereby infringes another’s patent which is still in force.</p>

<p class='c004'>The term of the patent shall be 20 years from the date on which the
application for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the application
contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application
under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c), from the date of the earliest such
application was filed, and subject to the payment of maintenance fees
as provided by law. A maintenance fee is due 3½, 7½ and 11½
years after the original grant for all patents issuing from the applications
filed on and after December 12, 1980. The maintenance fee must
be paid at the stipulated times to maintain the patent in force. After
the patent has expired anyone may make, use, offer for sale or sell or
import the invention without permission of the patentee, provided that
matter covered by other unexpired patents is not used. The terms may
be extended for certain Pharmaceuticals and for certain circumstances
as provided by law.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Maintenance Fees</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All utility patents which issue from applications filed on and after
December 12, 1980 are subject to the payment of maintenance fees
which must be paid to maintain the patent in force. These fees are
due at 3½, 7½ and 11½ years from the date the patent is granted
and can be paid without a surcharge during the “window-period”
which is the six month period preceding each due date, e.g., 3 years
to 3 years and six months. (See fee schedule for a list of maintenance
fees.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Failure to pay the current maintenance fee on time may result in expiration
of the patent. A 6–month grace period is provided when the
maintenance fee may be paid with a surcharge. The grace period is
the 6–month period immediately following the due date. The Patent
and Trademark Office does not mail notices to patent owners that
maintenance fees are due. If, however, the maintenance fee is not
paid on time, efforts are made to remind the responsible party that the
maintenance fee may be paid during the grace period with a surcharge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Patents relating to some pharmaceutical inventions may be extended
by the Commissioner for up to five years to compensate for marketing
delays due to Federal premarketing regulatory procedures. Patents
relating to all other types of inventions may be extended for certain
circumstances as provided by law.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Correction of Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Once the patent is granted, it is outside the jurisdiction of the Patent
and Trademark Office except in a few respects. The Office may issue
without charge a certificate correcting a clerical error it has made in
the patent when the printed patent does not correspond to the record
in the Office. These are mostly corrections of typographical errors
made in printing. Some minor errors of a typographical nature made
by the applicant may be corrected by a certificate of correction for
which a fee is required. The patentee may disclaim one or more
claims of his/her patent by filing in the Office a disclaimer as provided
by the statute.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the patent is defective in certain respects, the law provides that
the patentee may apply for a reissue patent. This is a patent granted to
replace the original and is granted only for the balance of the unexpired
term. However, the nature of the changes that can be made by
means of the reissue are rather limited; new matter cannot be added.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any person may file a request for reexamination of a patent, along
with the required fee, on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or
printed publications. At the conclusion of the reexamination proceedings,
a certificate setting forth the results of the reexamination proceeding
is issued.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Assignments and Licenses</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A patent is personal property and may be sold to others or mortgaged;
it may be bequeathed by a will, and it may pass to the heirs of a
deceased patentee. The patent law provides for the transfer or sale of
a patent, or of an application for patent, by an instrument in writing.
Such an instrument is referred to as an assignment and may transfer
the entire interest in the patent. The assignee, when the patent is
assigned to him or her, becomes the owner of the patent and has the
same rights that the original patentee had.</p>

<p class='c004'>The statute also provides for the assignment of a part interest, that is, a
half interest, a fourth interest, etc., in a patent. There may also be a
grant which conveys the same character of interest as an assignment
but only for a particularly specified part of the United States.</p>

<p class='c004'>A mortgage of patent property passes ownership thereof to the mortgagee
or lender until the mortgage has been satisfied and a retransfer
from the mortgagee back to the mortgagor, the borrower, is made. A
conditional assignment also passes ownership of the patent and is
regarded as absolute until canceled by the parties or by the decree of
a competent court.</p>

<p class='c004'>An assignment, grant, or conveyance of any patent or application for
patent should be acknowledged before a notary public or officer
authorized to administer oaths or perform notarial acts. The certificate
of such acknowledgment constitutes prima facie evidence of the execution
of the assignment, grant, or conveyance.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Recording of Assignments</h3>

<p class='c011'>The Office records assignments, grants, and similar instruments sent
to it for recording, and the recording serves as notice. If an assignment,
grant, or conveyance of a patent or an interest in a patent (or an
application for patent) is not recorded in the Office within three
months from its date, it is void against a subsequent purchaser for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>valuable consideration without notice, unless it is recorded prior to the
subsequent purchase.</p>

<p class='c004'>An instrument relating to a patent should identify the patent by number
and date (the name of the inventor and title of the invention as
stated in the patent should also be given). An instrument relating to an
application should identify the application by its application number
and date of filing, the name of the inventor, and title of the invention
as stated in the application should also be given. Sometimes an
assignment of an application is executed at the same time that the
application is prepared and before it has been filed in the Office. Such
assignment should adequately identify the application, as by its date of
execution and name of the inventor and title of the invention, so that
there can be no mistake as to the application intended.</p>

<p class='c004'>If an application has been assigned and the assignment is recorded,
on or before the date the issue fee is paid, the patent will be issued to
the assignee as owner. If the assignment is of a part interest only, the
patent will be issued to the inventor and assignee as joint owners.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Joint Ownership</h3>

<p class='c011'>Patents may be owned jointly by two or more persons as in the case
of a patent granted to joint inventors, or in the case of the assignment
of a part interest in a patent. Any joint owner of a patent, no matter
how small the part interest, may make, use, offer for sale and sell and
import the invention for his or her own profit provided they do not
infringe another’s patent rights, without regard to the other owners,
and may sell the interest or any part of it, or grant licenses to others,
without regard to the other joint owner, unless the joint owners have
made a contract governing their relation to each other. It is accordingly
dangerous to assign a part interest without a definite agreement
between the parties as to the extent of their respective rights and their
obligations to each other if the above result is to be avoided.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The owner of a patent may grant licenses to others. Since the patentee
has the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale
or selling or importing the invention, no one else may do any of these
things without his/her permission. A patent license agreement is in
essence nothing more than a promise by the licensor not to sue the
licensee. No particular form of license is required; a license is a contract
and may include whatever provisions the parties agree upon,
including the payment of royalties, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drawing up of a license agreement (as well as assignments) is
within the field of an attorney at law. Such attorney should be familiar
with patent matters as well. A few States have prescribed certain formalities
to be observed in connection with the sale of patent rights.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Infringement of Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Infringement of a patent consists of the unauthorized making, using,
offering for sale or selling any patented invention within the United
States or United States Territories, or importing into the United States
of any patented invention during the term of the patent. If a patent is
infringed, the patentee may sue for relief in the appropriate Federal
court. The patentee may ask the court for an injunction to prevent the
continuation of the infringement and may also ask the court for an
award of damages because of the infringement. In such an infringement
suit, the defendant may raise the question of the validity of the
patent, which is then decided by the court. The defendant may also
aver that what is being done does not constitute infringement.
Infringement is determined primarily by the language of the claims of
the patent and, if what the defendant is making does not fall within
the language of any of the claims of the patent, there is no literal
infringement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suits for infringement of patents follow the rules of procedure of the
Federal courts. From the decision of the district court, there is an
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Supreme
Court may thereafter take a case by writ of certiorari. If the United
States Government infringes a patent, the patentee has a remedy for
damages in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The
Government may use any patented invention without permission of
the patentee, but the patentee is entitled to obtain compensation for
the use by or for the Government.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Office has no jurisdiction over questions relating to infringement
of patents. In examining applications for patent, no determination is
made as to whether the invention sought to be patented infringes any
prior patent. An improvement invention may be patentable, but it
might infringe a prior unexpired patent for the invention improved
upon, if there is one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Patent Marking and “Patent Pending”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A patentee who makes or sells patented articles, or a person who
does so for or under the patentee is required to mark the articles with
the word “Patent” and the number of the patent. The penalty for failure
to mark is that the patentee may not recover damages from an
infringer unless the infringer was duly notified of the infringement and
continued to infringe after the notice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The marking of an article as patented when it is not in fact patented is
against the law and subjects the offender to a penalty. Some persons
mark articles sold with the terms “Patent Applied For” or “Patent
Pending.” These phrases have no legal effect, but only give information
that an application for patent has been filed in the Patent and
Trademark Office. The protection afforded by a patent does not start
until the actual grant of the patent. False use of these phrases or their
equivalent is prohibited.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Design Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The patent laws provide for the granting of design patents to any person
who has invented any new, original and ornamental design for an
article of manufacture. The design patent protects only the appearance
of an article, and not its structure or utilitarian features. The proceedings
relating to granting of design patents are the same as those
relating to other patents with a few differences.</p>

<p class='c004'>See current fee schedule for the filing fee for a design application. A
design patent has a term of 14 years from grant, and no fees are necessary
to maintain a design patent in force. If on examination it is
determined that an applicant is entitled to a design patent under the
law, a notice of allowance will be sent to the applicant or applicant’s
attorney, or agent, calling for the payment of an issue fee.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drawing of the design patent conforms to the same rules as other
drawings, but no reference characters are required.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specification of a design application is short and ordinarily follows
a set form. Only one claim is permitted, following a set form.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Plant Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The law also provides for the granting of a patent to anyone who has
invented or discovered and asexually reproduced any distinct and
new variety of plant, including cultivated sports, mutants, hybrids, and
newly found seedlings, other than a tuber-propagated plant or a plant
found in an uncultivated state.</p>

<p class='c004'>Asexually propagated plants are those that are reproduced by means
other than from seeds, such as by the rooting of cuttings, by layering,
budding, grafting, inarching, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>With reference to tuber-propagated plants, for which a plant patent
cannot be obtained, the term “tuber” is used in its narrow horticultural
sense as meaning a short, thickened portion of an underground
branch. Such plants covered by the term “tuber-propagated” are the
Irish potato and the Jerusalem artichoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>An application for a plant patent consists of the same parts as other
applications with the addition of a plant color coding sheet. The term
of a plant patent shall be 20 years from the date on which the application
for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the application
contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application under 35
U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c), from the date of the earliest such application
was filed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The application papers for a plant patent and any responsive papers
pursuant to the prosecution must be filed in duplicate but only one
need be signed (in the case of the application papers the original
should be signed); the second copy may be a legible copy of the original.
The reason for providing an original and duplicate file is that the
duplicate file is sent to the Agricultural Research Service, Department
of Agriculture for an advisory report on the plant variety.</p>

<p class='c004'>The specification should include a complete detailed description of
the plant and the characteristics thereof that distinguish the same over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>related known varieties, and its antecedents, expressed in botanical
terms in the general form followed in standard botanical text books or
publications dealing with the varieties of the kind of plant involved
(evergreen tree, dahlia plant, rose plant, apple tree, etc.), rather than a
mere broad non-botanical characterization such as commonly found
in nursery or seed catalogs. The specification should also include the
origin or parentage of the plant variety sought to be patented and must
particularly point out where and in what manner the variety of plant
has been asexually reproduced. Where color is a distinctive feature of
the plant, the color should be positively identified in the specification
by reference to a designated color as given by a recognized color dictionary.
Where the plant variety originated as a newly found seedling,
the specification must fully describe the conditions (cultivation, environment,
etc.) under which the seedling was found growing to establish
that it was not found in an uncultivated state.</p>

<p class='c004'>A plant patent is granted on the entire plant. It therefore follows that
only one claim is necessary and only one is permitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>The oath or declaration required of the applicant in addition to the
statements required for other applications must include the statement
that the applicant has asexually reproduced the new plant variety.</p>

<p class='c004'>Plant patent drawings are not mechanical drawings and should be
artistically and competently executed. The drawing must disclose all
the distinctive characteristics of the plant capable of visual representation.
When color is a distinguishing characteristic of the new variety,
the drawing must be in color. Two duplicate copies of color drawings
must be submitted. All color drawings should be so mounted as to
provide a 2–inch margin at the top for office markings when the patent
is printed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Specimens of the plant variety, its flower or fruit, should not be submitted
unless specifically called for by the examiner.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The filing fee on each plant application and the issue fee can be found
in the fee schedule. For a qualifying small entity filing and issue fees
are reduced by half.</p>

<p class='c004'>All inquiries relating to plant patents and pending plant patent applications
should be directed to the Patent and Trademark Office and not to
the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Plant Variety Protection Act (Public Law 91–577), approved
December 24, 1970, provides for a system of protection for sexually
reproduced varieties, for which protection was not previously provided,
under the administration of a Plant Variety Protection Office within
the Department of Agriculture. Requests for information regarding the
protection of sexually reproduced varieties should be addressed to
Commissioner, Plant Variety Protection Office, Agricultural Marketing
Service, National Agricultural Library Bldg., Room 500, 10301

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Treaties and Foreign Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Since the rights granted by a United States patent extend only throughout
the territory of the United States and have no effect in a foreign
country, an inventor who wishes patent protection in other countries
must apply for a patent in each of the other countries or in regional
patent offices. Almost every country has its own patent law, and a person
desiring a patent in a particular country must make an application
for patent in that country, in accordance with the requirements of that
country.</p>

<p class='c004'>The laws of many countries differ in various respects from the patent
law of the United States. In most foreign countries, publication of the
invention before the date of the application will bar the right to a
patent. In most foreign countries maintenance fees are required. Most
foreign countries require that the patented invention must be manufactured
in that country after a certain period, usually three years. If
there is no manufacture within this period, the patent may be void in
some countries, although in most countries the patent may be subject
to the grant of compulsory licenses to any person who may apply for a
license.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a treaty relating to patents which is adhered to by 140 countries,
including the United States, and is known as the Paris
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. It provides that
each country guarantees to the citizens of the other countries the
same rights in patent and trademark matters that it gives to its own citizens.
The treaty also provides for the right of priority in the case of
patents, trademarks and industrial designs (design patents). This right
means that, on the basis of a regular first application filed in one of the
member countries, the applicant may, within a certain period of time,
apply for protection in all the other member countries. These later
applications will then be regarded as if they had been filed on the
same day as the first application. Thus, these later applicants will have
priority over applications for the same invention which may have been
filed during the same period of time by other persons. Moreover, these
later applications, being based on the first application, will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>invalidated by any acts accomplished in the interval, such as, for
example, publication or exploitation of the invention, the sale of
copies of the design, or use of the trademark. The period of time mentioned
above, within which the subsequent applications may be filed
in the other countries, is 12 months in the case of first applications for
patent and six months in the case of industrial designs and trademarks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another treaty, known as the Patent Cooperation Treaty, was negotiated
at a diplomatic conference in Washington, D.C., in June of 1970.
The treaty came into force on January 24, 1978, and is presently
adhered to by over 90 countries, including the United States. The
treaty facilitates the filing of applications for patent on the same invention
in member countries by providing, among other things, for centralized
filing procedures and a standardized application format.</p>

<p class='c004'>The timely filing of an international application affords applicants an
international filing date in each country which is designated in the
international application and provides (1) a search of the invention
and (2) a later time period within which the national applications for
patent must be filed.</p>

<p class='c004'>A number of patent attorneys specialize in obtaining patents in foreign
countries. In general, an inventor should be satisfied that he/she could
make some profit from foreign patents or that there is some particular
reason for obtaining them, before he/she attempts to apply for foreign
patents.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under United States law it is necessary, in the case of inventions made
in the United States, to obtain a license from the Commissioner of
Patents and Trademarks before applying for a patent in a foreign country.
Such a license is required if the foreign application is to be filed
before an application is filed in the United States or before the expiration
of six months from the filing of an application in the United States.
The filing of an application for patent constitutes the request for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>license and the granting or denial of such request is indicated in the
filing receipt mailed to each applicant. After six months from the
United States filing, a license is not required unless the invention has
been ordered to be kept secret. If the invention has been ordered to
be kept secret, the consent to the filing abroad must be obtained from
the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks during the period the
order of secrecy is in effect.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Foreign Applicants for United States Patents</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The patent laws of the United States make no discrimination with
respect to the citizenship of the inventor. Any inventor, regardless of
his/her citizenship, may apply for a patent on the same basis as a U.S.
citizen. There are, however, a number of particular points of special
interest to applicants located in foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>The application for patent in the United States must be made by the
inventor and the inventor must sign the oath or declaration (with certain
exceptions), differing from the law in many countries where the
signature of the inventor and an oath of inventorship are not necessary.
If the inventor is dead, the application may be made by his/her
executor or administrator, or equivalent, and in the case of mental disability
it may be made by his/her legal representative (guardian).</p>

<p class='c004'>No United States patent can be obtained if the invention was patented
abroad before applying in the United States by the inventor or his/her
legal representatives or assigns on an application filed more than 12
months before filing in the United States. Six months are allowed in
the case of a design patent.</p>

<p class='c004'>An application for a patent filed in the United States by any person
who has previously regularly filed an application for a patent for the
same invention in a foreign country which affords similar privileges to
citizens of the United States shall have the same force and effect for
the purpose of overcoming intervening acts of others as if filed in the
United States on the date on which the application for a patent for the
same invention was first filed in such foreign country. This is the case,
provided the application in the United States is filed within 12 months
(six months in the case of a design patent) from the earliest date on
which any such foreign application was filed. A copy of the foreign
application certified by the patent office of the country in which it was
filed is required to secure this right of priority.</p>

<p class='c004'>If any application for patent has been filed in any foreign country by
the applicant or by his/her legal representatives or assigns prior to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>his/her application in the United States, the applicant must, in the oath
or declaration accompanying the application, state the country in
which the earliest such application has been filed, giving the date of
filing the application. All applications filed more than a year before the
filing in the United States must also be recited in the oath or declaration.</p>

<p class='c004'>An oath or declaration must be made with respect to every application.
When the applicant is in a foreign country the oath or affirmation
may be before any diplomatic or consular officer of the United States,
or before any officer having an official seal and authorized to administer
oaths in the foreign country, whose authority shall be proved by a
certificate of a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States. The
oath is attested in all cases by the proper official seal of the officer
before whom the oath is made.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the oath is taken before an officer in the country foreign to the
United States, all the application papers (except the drawing) must be
attached together and a ribbon passed one or more times through all
the sheets of the application, and the ends of the ribbons brought
together under the seal before the latter is affixed and impressed, or
each sheet must be impressed with the official seal of the officer
before whom the oath was taken.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the application is filed by the legal representative (executor, administrator,
etc.) of a deceased inventor, the legal representative must make
the oath or declaration.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a declaration is used, the ribboning procedure is not necessary,
nor is it necessary to appear before an official in connection with the
making of a declaration.</p>

<p class='c004'>A foreign applicant may be represented by any patent attorney or
agent who is registered to practice before the United States Patent and
Trademark Office.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Answers to Questions Frequently Asked</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>1. Q. What do the terms “patent pending” and “patent applied for”
mean?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. They are used by a manufacturer or seller of an article to inform the
public that an application for patent on that article is on file in the
Patent and Trademark Office. The law imposes a fine on those who
use these terms falsely to deceive the public.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Q. Is there any danger that the Patent and Trademark Office will give
others information contained in my application while it is pending?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No. All patent applications are maintained in the strictest secrecy
until the patent is issued. After the patent is issued, however, the
Office file containing the application and all correspondence leading
up to issuance of the patent is made available in the Files Information
Room for inspection by anyone and copies of these files may be purchased
from the Office.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. Q. May I write to the Patent and Trademark Office directly about my
application after it is filed?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. The Office will answer an applicant’s inquiries as to the status of
the application, and inform you whether your application has been
rejected, allowed, or is awaiting action. However, if you have a patent
attorney or agent of record in the application file the Office will not
correspond with both you and the attorney/agent concerning the merits
of your application. All comments concerning your application
should be forwarded through your attorney or agent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>4. Q. Is it necessary to go to the Patent and Trademark Office to transact
business concerning patent matters?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No; most business with the Office is conducted by correspondence.
Interviews regarding pending applications can be arranged with
examiners if necessary, however, and are often helpful.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. Q. If two or more persons work together to make an invention, to
whom will the patent be granted?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. If each had a share in the ideas forming the invention, they are joint
inventors and a patent will be issued to them jointly on the basis of a
proper patent application. If, on the other hand, one of these persons
has provided all of the ideas of the invention, and the other has only
followed instructions in making it, the person who contributed the
ideas is the sole inventor and the patent application and patent shall
be in his/her name alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. Q. If one person furnishes all of the ideas to make an invention and
another employs him or furnishes the money for building and testing
the invention, should the patent application be filed by them jointly?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No. The application must be signed by the true inventor, and filed in
the Patent and Trademark Office, in the inventors name. This is the
person who furnishes the ideas, not the employer or the person who
furnishes the money.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>7. Q. Does the Patent and Trademark Office control the fees charged
by patent attorneys and agents for their services?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No. This is a matter between you and your patent attorney or agent
in which the Office takes no part. To avoid misunderstanding you may
wish to ask for estimate charges for: (a) the search, (b) preparation of
the patent application, (c) Patent and Trademark Office prosecution.</p>

<p class='c004'>8. Q. Will the Patent and Trademark Office help me to select a patent
attorney or agent to make my patent search or to prepare and prosecute
my patent application?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No. The Office cannot make this choice for you. However, your own
friends or general attorney may help you in making a selection from
among those listed as registered practitioners on the Office roster.
Also, some bar associations operate lawyer referral services that maintain
lists of patent lawyers available to accept new clients.</p>

<p class='c004'>9. Q. Will the Patent and Trademark Office advise me as to whether a
certain patent promotion organization is reliable and trustworthy?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. No. The Office has no control over such organizations and does not
supply information about them. It is advisable, however, to check on
the reputation of invention promotion firms before making any commitments.
It is suggested that you obtain this information by inquiring
of the Better Business Bureau of the city in which the organization is
located, or of the bureau of commerce and industry or bureau of consumer
affairs of the state in which the organization has its place of
business. You may also undertake to make sure that you are dealing
with reliable people by asking your own patent attorney or agent or by
inquiry of others who may know them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>10. Q. Are there any organizations in my area which can tell me how
and where I may be able to obtain assistance in developing and marketing
my invention?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. Yes. In your own or neighboring communities you may inquire of
such organizations as chambers of commerce, and banks. Many communities
have locally financed industrial development organizations
which can help you locate manufacturers and individuals who might
be interested in promoting your idea.</p>

<p class='c004'>11. Q. Are there any state government agencies that can help me in
developing and marketing of my invention?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. Yes. In nearly all states there are state planning and development
agencies or departments of commerce and industry which seek new
product and new process ideas to assist manufacturers and communities
in the state. If you do not know the names or addresses of your
state organizations you can obtain this information by writing to the
governor of your state.</p>

<p class='c004'>12. Q. Can the Patent and Trademark Office assist me in the developing
and marketing of my patent?</p>

<p class='c004'>A. The Office cannot act or advise concerning the business transactions
or arrangements that are involved in the development and marketing
of an invention. However, the Office will publish, at the request
of a patent owner, a notice in the Official Gazette that the patent is
available for licensing or sale. The fee for this is $25.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
